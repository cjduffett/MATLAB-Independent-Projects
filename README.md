MATLAB Independent Projects
===========================

At Boston University I am a teaching assistant for an introductory programming class, **EK127: Introduction to Engineering Computation**. This class uses MATLAB to teach new students the fundamentals of computer programming. Here are some fun projects I developed as a student, a TA, and an independent thinker.

Projects Developed while a Student:
-----------------------------------
* **Enigma Machine** - a command-line program that simulates the cyphering operation of an enigma machine. Given the correct rotor settings a message can be encrypted or decrypted.
* **A4 Protein Alzheimers Test** - a tool that analyzes a long chain of DNA proteins to test for alzheimers. Operates on sample data provided by a Biomedical Engineering course at BU.
* **BUSAT Data Analysis** - analyzes and displays data obtained from BU's satelite team, including accelerometer and gyroscope data from several rocket launches.

Projects Developed Independently:
---------------------------------
* **Tic Tac Toe** - self explanatory.
* **Simon Says** - comes in two distinct flavors: vanilla and sadistic. In the sadistic version the pattern never repeats!
* **Slider Puzzle** - a 4x4 sliding puzzle game. The tile positions are randomized and the player must slide the tiles back into order.
* **edX edge** - EK127 uses the edX edge online courseware platform to present content to students. Some of this content is embedded MATLAB programming problems that instantly grade student solutions. I developed many of the problems and auto-grader scripts used for this course, as well as a parser to compress student code for consistent grading.

**Slider Puzzle** inspired an app development tutorial that I created for the Technology Innovation Scholars Program (TISP) at BU. This tutorial is open source and available in my [Slider-Puzzle](https://github.com/Slider-Puzzle/Slider-Puzzle) GitHub repo. You can also download the app on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TISP.sliderpuzzle).
